A comprehensive music collection maintained by two music collection hobbyists and a developer.

## About

Over the course of several decades, my dad has collected a substantial heap of music material. 
He has amassed around 1 TB in audio files and relevant multimedia documents as a huge fan of 
afrofuturism, jazz, vintage music, records, and more. 

In early 2023, I began work on designing a database to organize this vast collection, and to
provide a simple mechanism with a friendly interface for my dad to use in his music-related activities.
The idea has evolved into a public databank where fellow hobbyists will eventually explore and 
chat about unique and novelty tracks.

In late 2023, I began work on the frontend web component of the project. As of December 2023, the
website is *not* complete, but simple functionalities have been established in regards to session
handling and the API. Bootstrap is used liberally throughout the website as a frontend framework for convenience.
